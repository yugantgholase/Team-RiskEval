The environment has high confidentiality requirements and is accessible over the network with no privileges required and no user interaction, increasing the risk of information disclosure (CWE-215) and exposure of debug information (CWE-489). The modified CVSS metrics (Attack Vector: Network, Attack Complexity: Low, Privileges Required: None, User Interaction: None, Scope: Changed, Confidentiality: High, Integrity: High, Availability: Low) result in a high score due to the potential for attackers to exploit debug features to gain sensitive information or further compromise the system.",

Review deployment pipelines to enforce this as a quality gate. Regularly audit production code for accidental exposure of debug features.",

The environment is production, public-facing, and handles sensitive data, with high confidentiality requirements. The attack vector is network-based, with low complexity and no privileges or user interaction required, and the impact on confidentiality and integrity is high. These factors significantly increase the risk, resulting in a high CVSS score.",

If hashing is used for password storage, use a slow, salted hash (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Ensure all cryptographic operations follow best practices and are implemented using well-maintained libraries. Conduct a security review and update dependencies as needed.",
